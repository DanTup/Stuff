Remark Demo
=====

A very empty slideshow using [remark](http://remarkjs.com/), a Markdown-driven slideshow tool!

Slides are driven from this [Markdown Text File](Slides.txt)

- Open the slideshow [here](http://blog.dantup.com/Stuff/Index.html)
- Press 'c' to clone into a new window (so you have one for presenting, one for external screen)
- Press 'f' to toggle fullscreen
- Press 'p' to set current window into presenter mode
- Use cursor keys throughto advance through slides

Some cool things I like:

1. The slides are bigger in presenter view than in GDocs Slides!
2. It's MARKDOWN! This is so much easier for me than WYSIWYG editors :)
3. The default styles I stole from the [remark website](http://remarkjs.com/) look snazzy (I'm no designer!)
4. You can "append to previous slide" by using "--" instead of "---" between slides
5. Speak notes get appended in the same way; effectively giving you synchronised speaker notes with each itm appearing (this is shown in the [demo slides](http://blog.dantup.com/Stuff/Index.html), press 'p' for presenter mode)
